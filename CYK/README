Directory Structure :

Folder Part 1:
	parse_train.counts.out = File consists of the modified counts
	replace_rare_finaly.py = Program which replaces rare terminals with _RARE_

FoLder Part 2:
	parse_dev.out = File which consists of all the parse trees in JSON format for dev dataset
	parse_test.p2.out = File which consists of all the parse trees in JSON format for testing dataset
	eval.out = File which contains evaluation description of the decoder wrt to dev dataset
	cky_final.py = Program which implements the cky algorithm and generates the best parse trees for a number of sentences

Comments on the obtained evaluation description : 
	We get precision of 0.810, recall of 0.783 and F1-Score of 0.796. These are not 1.0 due to conversion of rare words to _RARE_. Also we get precision,recall and f1-score as 0.0 for QP, since no tree for the training data uses any production rule with QP to derive the tree.
